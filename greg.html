<h2>Sr. Tech Advisor</h2>
<ul>
<p>Greg Paduano has been a business professional for 20 years working in Accounting and Finance for 5 years, and as a sales engineer for the  rest.  
 Deciding to take a leap of faith into tech and using his business knowledge, Greg bootcamped his way through development and joined up XYZ Co. and his friend Erwin to try something new. 
 Greg has always had big lofty goals he planned to achieve and a strong work ethic he brought with him to do so.

 As XYZ Co. Senior Advisor his objective is to develop and help clients see their long-term dreams come true.
 Greg received his BS in Accounting from Penn State University. In addition to time spent with clients, Greg donates his free time to charity, being involved in numerous groups and various causes. He currently resides on Long Island.</p>
