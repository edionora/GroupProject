    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h4>How we came to be:</h4>
   
    <p> It all started in 2000... Would you believe we started out in a garage with three computers, a coffee machine, and space heater to stay warm. 
        It’s true. Back in 2000 with widespread Y2K panic, we figured to take a stab when people thought the world would go dark. In ‘00, our founder, Erwin,
        turned right when everyone else was turning left, bringing even more inovative tech to the worlds fingertips. Knowing he couldnt go it alone, he called 
        upon two trusted companions Greg and Darryl to help him bring business and tech together.</p>
   <br>
    <p> We made eyes open wide with dazzling images, incredible fonts, and real products always delivered on time. We started packaging innovative, hard-to-duplicate, products, that 
        helped businesses grow their bottom line immediately. Not only saving you money but helping us grow. A value that cannot be measured.
        And that’s important, because increasing “Value” is integral part of our pie chart. And we promise ‘Value,’ each and everytime you call on us to make your website more 
        structured and valuable to your end users.</p>

    <h4> So why are we the best?</h4>
